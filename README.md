# YOLOv11 Model Training for Construction Site Safety

## Overview

This project utilizes the YOLOv11 model for object detection aimed at enhancing safety compliance on construction sites. The model detects personal protective equipment (PPE) such as helmets, goggles, vests, and gloves from images of construction environments.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detect multiple classes of PPE in real-time.
- **Performance Metrics Tracking**: Includes loss, precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skumbham/PPE-Detection-Using-Yolo11
cd PPE-Detection-Using-Yolo11
pip install -r requirements.txt
